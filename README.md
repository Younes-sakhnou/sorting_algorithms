# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description

### Big O Notaiton
Quick note, this is almost certainly confusing Big O notation (which is an upper bound) with Theta notation "Θ" (which is a two-side bound). In my experience, this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused.


## Environment

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS via Vagrant in VirtualBox and compiled with GCC version 4.8.4


### Resources:books:
Read or watch:
* [Sorting algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
* [Big O notation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/what-is-a-plain-english-explanation-of-big-o-notation)
* [Sorting algorithms animations](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms)
* [15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg)


### Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

### Intructions basics

-   Compiling the program: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o <namefile>`

```

vagrant@ubuntu-focal:~/sorting_algorithms$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-bubble_sort.c 0-main.c print_array.c -o bubble

## Respository Contenst

Monty Files:

| File | Description
| ------------- |:-------------:|

 ## Requirements project

-  Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
-   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
-   CompilingYour programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   AllYour code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
-   AllYou are not allowed to use global variables
-   AllNo more than 5 functions per file
-   Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
-   In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
-   Don’t forget to push your header file
-   UnlessAll your header files should be include guarded
-   AllNo list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

## Tasks

-   CompilingPrototype: void bubble_sort(int *array, size_t size);
-   You’re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
-   Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

-   Compiling Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);

### 5. Cocktail shaker sort
-   Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm
